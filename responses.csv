Leah Parsons and Leah Oickle in conversation with Roy Ellis.

When 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons died by suicide in 2013 following a traumatic period of harassment and public shaming, her mother Leah began a long and harrowing grief odyssey. Leah's path through sorrow included community and online bullying, struggles with the legal system, a media circus that she had no control over, complex post-traumatic stress disorder and a sudden diagnosis of fibromyalgia. 

One afternoon in the Spring of 2021, Leah Oickle's five-year old son Max went on a drive with his grandmother and never came home. A horrific collision sent Max to hospital with fatal injuries. Max was Leah and her husband Devin’s only child and had been conceived through a challenging process of in vitro fertilization. In the aftermath of the death, the couple found themselves spinning in an unthinkable world of loss and trauma. Two years later, they brough another child into the world via surrogacy and found themselves grieving a son while welcoming a new daughter into their lives.

The two Leah's have powerful and poignant stories to share. Both losses were devastatingly traumatic, psychologically acute and highly visible within their respective communities. Both women articulate paths to wholeness through very different lenses, and with very different trajectories.

Roy Ellis will facilitate a conversation with these two bright and self-aware women concerning their struggles as grieving mothers and their separate paths to healing.

Roy Ellis is a trauma therapist and author working out of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Time frame: 1.5 hrs. 
60 minutes of facilitated dialogue.

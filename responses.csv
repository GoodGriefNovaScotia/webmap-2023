"The International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement",https://www.iwgddb.com,,"How would you know if your community was grief literate?


In 2018, the Public Health sub-group of the International Work Group on Death, Dying, and Bereavement asked themselves this question. Out of their reflective process they developed and defined the concept: Grief Literacy.

Grief Literacy is the capacity to access, process and use knowledge about the experience of loss to better support all the grievers in our communities. While grief is universal, Grief Literacy will be unique to each community. Grief literacy is a fundamental component of societies that value compassion, community, and mutual support. Broad acceptance and further development of Grief Literacy depends on open communication, identifying challenges and obstacles to promote awareness, and inspiring action aimed at creating more compassionate communities around us.

The idea of Grief Literacy has spread around the world – Grief Literacy belongs to everyone!

Grief Literacy asks us all to reflect on: How would we know if our social worlds were grief literate? Our understandings of Grief Literacy and our abilities to transform these understandings into action will be developed and deepened through the conference, Grief Literacy: From Theory to Action.

The goals of this conference are to:

·              Provide a conceptual overview of Grief Literacy;

·              Showcase examples of Grief Literacy from around the world;

·              Provide tools for participants to move ‘from theory to action’ in their own communities.",Grief Literacy: From Theory to Action,In-person,Dalhousie University - Collaborative Health Education Building,5793 University Ave,,Yes,For the public,They should register,Paid,,September 30,8:30AM - 5PM ADT,X,,B3H 4R2,Halifax,,https://www.ticketscene.ca/events/45006/,X,,,,https://www.goodgriefnovascotia.ca/schedule#calendar-0df95af3-fbd9-40a7-b19c-ff181ca13476-event-ljhhotdl,https://www.ticketscene.ca/events/45006/,5793 University Ave Halifax Canada,"5793 University Ave, Halifax, NS B3H",44.639324,-63.582899,1,rooftop,City of Halifax Open Government License - Canada V2.0

Feature Documentary
Q & A with local award winning Director Johanna Lunn

How can we talk about death? What is a good death? Does the body need help to die? What quality of life is enough for us? Where do we want to die? What is a conscious death?

Whether you are caring for an aging loved one or looking ahead to your own death, Saying Goodby: Preparing for Death opens the door to honest conversations about what we feel, think, and want when death approaches. Don’t wait until you’re in crisis to decide how you want to be cared for. Making decisions now about what we want when facing the inevitable is a great kindness to yourself, and to your loved ones. This and understanding what could happens when you die, can help prepare the ground for healthy grieving.

This is the second installment of the When You Die documentary trilogy. 

Experts featured in the documentary:
Rev. David Maginley, M.Div; Dr. Ann Marie Chiasson, MD, MPH, CCFB; Julie McFadden, RN; Rev. Olivia Bareham; Sue Brayne, MA; Dr. Penny Sartori, PhD, RN; Dr. Peter Fenwick, MDDCh, DPM FRCPsych; Dr. Anthony Bossis, PhD; Dr. Andrew Holecek, DDS; Jill Schock, MA; Dr. Laurie Mallery, MD, FRCPC, MSM; Dr. Paige Moorehouse, MD, MPH, FRCPC, MSM.

Running time is 54 minutes.

What is the When You Die Documentary Trilogy?
The When You Die documentary trilogy seeks to foster good conversations around death by de-mystifying the dying process and reducing our fear of death through knowledge. With insight and humour, these topics are explored with leading clinicians who have spent their careers at the beside. By discussing what happens when we die with curiosity and compassion, death can be seen as part of the natural rhythm of life.

What is the When You Die Project?
From existential afterlife questions such as, “What happens when you die?” To palliative care and the nuts-and bolts of preparing for end of life, if it has to do with death, we’re talking about it. 

Located in Halifax our resources are used around the world. Check us out  at www.WhenYouDie.org for podcasts, resources, social media pages and to stream our award-winning documentaries.

Who is Johanna Lunn?
Co-founder of the When You Die Project, Johanna is an award-winning producer and director with more than 35 years of film and television experience. For the past 10 years she has been using her life long curiously about the death and the dying process to create documentaries about “What happens when we die” to life.

“At a young age I witnessed a number of significant deaths that completely cracked my world apart. Because it was taboo to talk about death at the time, I felt terribly isolated. Looking back on those experiences, and with the wisdom of having done much research on dying, I have learned that death, like birth, is one of the most extraordinary events in life, and it is critical that we learn to talk about it.”

By talking about death and exploring what happens, Johanna hopes to make the topic a less fearful and a more ordinary part of life - one film at a time. She lives in Nova Scotia with her husband Steve and their intrepid chocolate lab Gracie.

South Shore Hospice Palliative Care Society,www.southshorehospice.ca,https://www.facebook.com/SouthShoreHospicePalliativeCareSociety/,"This workshop invites you to attend to the many layers and types of grief we     experience in our everyday lives. That which is acute and present in the moment, and that which is outside of our awareness. We will explore these layers through discussion, mindfulness practice, and spontaneous art making in a small group setting. Creating art as a response to the themes and the emotions that arise from them allows us not only to express our grief in a safe and contained way, but to invite it to change our way of being with it. It provides a connection with unacknowledged inner experiences and can offer an outlet to relieve the weight of those experiences. 
You do not need to be an artist or have any artistic skill or experience to attend this workshop and there is no cost to participants.
